  Google APIs must use the canonical error codes defined by [google.rpc.Code](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/rpc/code.proto).
  Individual APIs must avoid defining additional error codes,
  since developers are very unlikely to write logic to handle a large number of error codes.
  For reference,
  handling an average of three error codes per API call would mean most application logic would just be for error handling,
  which would not be a good developer experience.
