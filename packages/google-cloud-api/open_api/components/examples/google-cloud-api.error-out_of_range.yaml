summary: Out of range
description: |
  The operation was attempted past the valid range.  E.g., seeking or
  reading past end-of-file.

  Unlike `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, this error indicates a problem that may
  be fixed if the system state changes. For example, a 32-bit file
  system will generate `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if asked to read at an
  offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1], but it will generate
  `OUT_OF_RANGE` if asked to read from an offset past the current
  file size.

  There is a fair bit of overlap between `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and
  `OUT_OF_RANGE`.  We recommend using `OUT_OF_RANGE` (the more specific
  error) when it applies so that callers who are iterating through
  a space can easily look for an `OUT_OF_RANGE` error to detect when
  they are done.
