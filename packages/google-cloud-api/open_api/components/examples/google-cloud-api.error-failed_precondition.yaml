summary: Failed precondition
description: |
  The operation was rejected because the system is not in a state
  required for the operation's execution.  For example, the directory
  to be deleted is non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to
  a non-directory, etc.

  Service implementors can use the following guidelines to decide
  between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, `ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`:
   (a) Use `UNAVAILABLE` if the client can retry just the failing call.
   (b) Use `ABORTED` if the client should retry at a higher level. For
       example, when a client-specified test-and-set fails, indicating the
       client should restart a read-modify-write sequence.
   (c) Use `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the client should not retry until
       the system state has been explicitly fixed. For example, if an "rmdir"
       fails because the directory is non-empty, `FAILED_PRECONDITION`
       should be returned since the client should not retry unless
       the files are deleted from the directory.
