  The caller does not have permission to execute the specified
  operation. `PERMISSION_DENIED` must not be used for rejections
  caused by exhausting some resource (use `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`
  instead for those errors). `PERMISSION_DENIED` must not be
  used if the caller can not be identified (use `UNAUTHENTICATED`
  instead for those errors). This error code does not imply the
  request is valid or the requested entity exists or satisfies
  other pre-conditions.
